Week 1
This week I did not use AI other than for 3 of the prompts on the coding 
exercises. I only use generative AI if I have no other method of getting help. 
This was one of those cases as I knew there were too many questions to get 
the proper help, and it cleared up some syntax problems that had me 
stumped.
