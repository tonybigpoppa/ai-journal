AI Usage Journal

Week 1
This week I did not use AI other than for 3 of the prompts on the coding 
exercises. I only use generative AI if I have no other method of getting help. 
This was one of those cases as I knew there were too many questions to get 
the proper help, and it cleared up some syntax problems that had me 
stumped.

Week 2
The AI usage definitely increased. It became a crutch for nailing the syntax
and format on the more complex loops that we had to do. Part of my usage
was also to conserve time, as I am on a time crunch at the moment.

Week 3
My AI usage has changed week to week. This week I was able to keep 
all of the code human-written, with one exception. However, my AI usage 
increased, this time more as a teacher. It was answering questions about 
why my code wasn't  working so I could adjust accordingly. It only wrote one 
of the prompts forme, with me rewriting it in a way that reflected my coding 
style after I took the time to understand what it wrote for me.

Week 4
Much of the same. I need slightly more help with direction from AI this week.
